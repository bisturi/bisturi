In this case we want create simple packet TLP (Type-Length-Payload) with the next format
 - type: 1 byte
 - length: 4 bytes (big endian, unsigned)
 - payload: 'length' bytes

We translate this into a python's class

>>> from packet import Packet
>>> from field import Int, Data
>>> class TLP(Packet):
...    type = Int(1)
...    length = Int()
...    payload = Data(length)

To check that all the fields were correctly created, we can see them
>>> [name for name, field in TLP.get_fields()]
['type', 'length', 'payload']
